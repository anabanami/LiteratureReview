The relevant theory behind your project;

The background experiments or observations (in the case of astrophysics) and results which are already published;

The specific nature of the materials and/or techniques which are to be employed;

The theory underlying these techniques at the level that will be required by you in interpreting data to be collected during your project research; and

(specifically for students undertaking a theoretical project) a detailed discussion of the theoretical/mathematical background to the project together with the demonstration of an awareness of the experimental evidence supporting the theoretical models.







Do I clearly present my theme(s) ?
    bigpicture
 


% How do I my readings and observations to accomplish that? 

I want to talk about 

[X]    the C operator 

[X]    equivalence between DH & NHPTs 

[]    bi-orthogonality

[]    time evolution

[]    geometry?

[]    dictionary

    most recent findings

    Aspects have not been investigated -i.e. experimental applications

    what have I done
        -formal equivalence dict
        -application of PT Matrix formalism to HO and Htilde
